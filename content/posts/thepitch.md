Good day all! The idea of a new league of radio clubs that can represent and bring forward priviously marginalized voices has been marinating for some time now. I recently got some rough ideas down on paper however, 
and will soon be scheduling a conference call of some type for anyone who likes this idea to be able to attend.  During that call I ll share my pitch for how to get the Radio League of America up and running, and my ideas
for how to identify a board of directors to formalize things and get them moving. I also have some draft documents such as a mission statement, bylaws, and code of conduct posted into the Radio League of America github, 
as a starting point for finlazing some of those documents after a board is identified.

Stay tuned for the time and channnel!
